# TrueSight DAO Proposals Repository

This repository contains all community proposals for the TrueSight DAO, managed through an automated proposal management system that enables transparent, democratic governance.

## üéØ What This Repository Is

This is the **main proposals repository** where all community proposals are stored as GitHub pull requests. Each proposal goes through a structured voting process, and the results are automatically processed based on community votes.

## üèóÔ∏è How The System Works

### 1. **Proposal Creation**
- Community members submit proposals through the **DApp interface**
- Proposals are automatically converted into GitHub pull requests
- Each PR contains the full proposal content and voting information

### 2. **Voting Process**
- DAO members vote on proposals using **digital signatures**
- Votes are posted as comments on the pull requests
- Real-time vote tabulation is maintained automatically

### 3. **Automatic Processing**
- After the voting period expires (7 days), proposals are automatically processed
- **Majority YES votes** ‚Üí Pull request is **merged** (proposal approved)
- **Majority NO votes** ‚Üí Pull request is **closed** (proposal rejected)
- **Insufficient votes** ‚Üí Proposal remains open for extended discussion
