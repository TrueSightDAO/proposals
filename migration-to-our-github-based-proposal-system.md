# Migration to our Github based proposal system

The current system we are utilizing on Solana Realm is not very intuitive for majority of the members of our DAO

Most of our members are not crypto natives, requiring them to understand how crypto wallets work and then buying and having Solana on their wallet which they then have to stake in Realms before they can exercise their voting rights is just too complex.

With this new system below, members just need to ensure their digital signature is registered with our DAO and they can just go ahead to submit a proposal or vote on it.
