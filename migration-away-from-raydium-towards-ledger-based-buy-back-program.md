# Migration away from Raydium towards Ledger based buy back program

Our current program for executing via Raydium is not very intuitive for DAO members seeking to cash out their voting rights as it still require them to understand how cryptocurrency wallets like Phantom works as well as how to acquire Solana coins and then load the Solana coins into their wallet before they can convert their TDG into other currency like USDT which they could then cash out.

Meanwhile in light of this usability issue with Solana, we are still sinking a portion of the DAO funds on a daily basis into the Raydium based liquidity pool which is basically detracting liquidity from our actual pool of resources.

Rather than further committing to this liquidity drain on our treasury, it makes better sense to establish as a provision USD - buyback reserve on our ledger and then credit it with the daily budget that DAO has set aside for buy back purposes.

As and when DAO members want to cash out their voting rights via the Dapp module below, we will debit from the reserve
